# Express-App-MEAN-Day3-
Express.JS app that behaves as follows:

/api/countries displays the text file: ten_most_populated_countries.json

/api/capitals displays the text file: canada_capitals.json

/ displays a home page with the message "View JSON feeds" followed by links to the above two services

The JSON text files must be dynamically read from the file system.

- return contents of ten_most_populated_countries.json as pure raw JSON with Header >> Content-Type: application/json

- display the contents of canada_capitals.json in a neat looking and colorful HTML table in the view
